# Just a simple, authentic guy who likes to create aesthetic designs.  
No filters. No ego. Just real work.

I’ve been designing since childhood — over 12 years now — and have touched nearly every part of the digital design stack since.

UI/UX is where I’m strongest — but I’ve worked across motion, interaction, 3D, prototyping, research, writing, dev, and more.

In my free time, I’m actively leveling up my skills with **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **TailwindCSS**.
